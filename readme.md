# Pixel art editor

## Requirements

    PHP: >=8.2

    Node.js 20 (if you use nvm): nvm use 20

## Description

This app is a pixel art editor.
Choose a color, then click on the grid to colorize the cells.
Hold down the 'A' key to enable drawing mode while hovering over the boxes.
Right-click a box to pick its color.

The tools at the top right let you clear the grid or save your drawing as a PNG.

The form on the right sends a request to ChatGPT to generate a picture
and automatically fill the grid with the result.
You'll see both the image generated by the AI and its 21×21 pixel approximation.

## To-Do

    Make the grid size customizable

    Add a tool to fill the entire grid with the selected color

## Setup

`git clone https://github.com/frvaillant/pixel-art-editor your-folder-name`  
`cd your-folder-name`  
`cp .env .env.local`  

    Then, fill in the required environment variables.
    At a minimum, APP_SECRET and DATABASE_URL must be set, but they don’t need to be valid for local development.

`composer install`  
`yarn install`   

`symfony server:start`  
or  
`php -S localhost:8000 -t public`  

Now you're ready to start creating pixel art!
